# Claudecraft — Decisions & Deviations

## 2026-06-12 — Colon in repository path breaks npm/Vite defaults

The repo lives under `…/Side:Fun Projects/claudecraft`. The `:` is the PATH
delimiter, so npm cannot prepend `node_modules/.bin` to PATH for run-scripts,
and Vite's `server.fs` allow-list path matching rejects the project root.

**Workarounds (no behavior change for a fresh clone in a normal path):**
- `package.json` scripts call binaries by explicit path (`./node_modules/.bin/vite`).
- `vite.config.ts` sets `server.fs.strict = false` (dev server only).

## 2026-06-12 — Dev-only dependency: `puppeteer-core`

Added `puppeteer-core` as a devDependency, plus `scripts/browser-check.mjs`,
to satisfy the workflow rule that each phase's acceptance criteria be verified
by running the game in a real browser. It drives the locally installed Brave
(Chromium) headlessly to capture console errors, FPS, and screenshots. It is
not part of the game build and ships no assets.
